Test output failed to match any acceptable form.

Acceptable output:
  (dir-rm-parent) begin
  (dir-rm-parent) mkdir "a"
  (dir-rm-parent) chdir "a"
  (dir-rm-parent) mkdir "b"
  (dir-rm-parent) chdir "b"
  (dir-rm-parent) remove "/a" (must fail)
  (dir-rm-parent) end

- (dir-rm-parent) mkdir "b"
- (dir-rm-parent) chdir "b"
